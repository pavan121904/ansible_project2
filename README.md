## Introduction

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices emphasize the importance of proactively monitoring infrastructure and applications to ensure high availability and reliability. This project addresses this need by creating a comprehensive monitoring and alerting system.

## Monitoring Tools

### Grafana and Prometheus

- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It can integrate with various data sources, including Prometheus, to create customizable dashboards and visualize data from your infrastructure.

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. It scrapes metrics from configured targets, stores them, and enables querying and alerting. Prometheus is highly flexible and can be used to monitor a wide range of services and applications.

## Automation with Ansible

To streamline the setup and configuration of monitoring agents on your infrastructure, we leverage Ansible, an open-source automation tool. Ansible playbooks and roles are used to automate the installation and configuration of monitoring agents, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
